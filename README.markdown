# ExtremeCSS TextMate Bundle

This bundle is intended for hardcore CSS coders who want to maximize
their productivity. It is originally inspired by
[mCSS bundle](https://github.com/minimaldesign/mCSS.tmbundle)
but it's smarter and more feature-rich:

* Intelligent value and color input
* More snippets to support CSS 3 attributes
* Duplicate rule/selector command (`ctrl+shift+d`)


## Installation (TextMate)

* Load TextMate and disable or remove default CSS bundle
* Open up Terminal.app
* Execute this command:  
  `cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/`
* If that directory wasn't found, you'll need to create it, then:
* `git clone git://github.com/grassator/ExtremeCSS.tmbundle.git`
* Restart TextMate or in menu choose  
  *Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles*
  
## Installation (Sublime Text 2)

Open up Terminal.app and execute these commands:

    cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/"Sublime Text 2"/Packages/
    git clone git://github.com/grassator/ExtremeCSS.tmbundle.git ExtremeCSS`
